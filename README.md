## Quickstart ##

* If you already have *make*, *rebar* and *git* in your path (even on windows), from within the top level folder run the following commands:
    * make (will download dependencies and build everything)
	* launch (will initialise the runtime environment)
    * north_pole:start() (starts the application)
    * available at http://localhost:4242
